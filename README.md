Version 4.0
----------------------
This is second approach used for work on MDroid. We used seperate classes for
Activities, parsing, network operations and other helper tasks. The UI has been
completely redesigned. This version only reproduces the functionality of the 
previous approach on a new design and well organised classes. The next release
would contain notifications service. Until this point, there were no background
services, whatso ever, run by MDroid. However, the notifications services would
be running background services so, that development will be continued on a 
differnet branch.


Development
----------------------
This branch is stalled and there won't be any future development on this branch.
If you wish to develop upon this, I strongly recommend you to check the newer 
versions. Version 5.0 branch could be a good alternative if you can go with 
having background services. If not, you may use this version as your point of
development.
