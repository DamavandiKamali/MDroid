Version 3.0
----------------------
This is the first approach taken for MDroid development. A single class for each
activity. There are obviously redundancies due to this approach and also a lot 
of cluttering in the classes. To address these, a new approach has been taken
and everything is written from scratch. Check Version 4.0 branch for follow up.


Development
----------------------
This branch is stalled and there won't be any future development on this branch.
If you wish to develop upon this, I strongly recommend you to check the newer 
versions. Version 4.0 branch could be a good alternative.
